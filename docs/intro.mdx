# Introduction

_<ProjectTitle/>_ is a first-person multiplayer action rpg dungeon crawler. Players cooperate to fight enemies, unlock secrets, gather materials to upgrade their characters, and clearing dungeon missions.

The game blends the challenging directional aiming combat - like _Mordhau_ and _Chilvary_ - with interesting RPG classes like in _Warhammer: Vermintide 2_.
