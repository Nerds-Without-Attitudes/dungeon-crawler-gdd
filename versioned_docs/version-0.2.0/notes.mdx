This document is simply an unpolished collection of thoughts that might make into
the final document or not.

## COMBAT

Directional combat affects if you’re landing hits or not, and how much damage you do according to the limb affected.

Some monsters will have different “vulnerable” zones, either on their heads or back or specific limbs.

Some monster may carry shields to protect themselves and possibly block attacks coming from that direction

Similarly, players can block projectile/attacks if they hold shield and look at the attack, effectively putting the shield between them and the attack.

Shield efficiency also depends on size of weapon and area eg if you don’t put the shield high enough you don’t block an arrow from above. Some bigger swords/magic spells may totally or partially pierce a shield. 

Maybe could also be interesting to break shields in those instances. What about incorporating crafting mechanics to restore shields or makeshift them? 


## AI

Difficulty can’t only be scaled by numbers. Enemies should feel like they have better reasoning, hardest difficulty shouldn’t simply one shot the players.

Telegraphed attacks and variation should not only have different timings (to throw off player rhythm) but also different animations so it’s a clear cue to the player that something’s really different.

## QUESTS

Should be found in the HUB quest board. These aren’t all locked, so players can try advanced ones and try their luck.

Finding secrets in dungeons should also unlock new quests.

## PROGRESSION

Should feel like monster hunter mixed with Valheim. Players can equip all weapons, but using the same weapon increases proficiency with it. 

Other activities should also increase skill level, sprinting, jumping, and this proficiency change the effectiveness of it, sprinting longer/faster, jumping costing less stamina, etc.

As in monster hunter, new weapons/armors, can be crafted with materials you gather in the world. They basically increase stats, but could also have different effectiveness per area, maybe also different poise base move speed or higher damage against certain things like magic (a fire sword) being good against ghosts.

## CLASSES

Not sure if going for class based is actually interesting, but it should have some different base abilities that have synergy with certain weapons, so it leaves space for players to figure out the “meta”, come up with builds and variations. Maybe similar to races in Skyrim? 

What could be taken from dark and darker/dungeonborne?
