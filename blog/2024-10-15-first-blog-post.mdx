Hello! My name is Leo, I'm an Engineer and have worked in many titles ranging from
indie to AAA games, all of them multiplayer.

This new project aims avoid the mistakes I've made, and seen, in all of the projects 
I've worked on, mainly from the ones that failed.

I believe the market needs more fun coop games and experiences without all of 
the predatory practices with microtransactions and everything we've seen in the
recent years.

I want to make a game that everybody can play, at a decent price, that is immersive
and a homage to the games I love.

Expect it to be easy to learn, hard to master, and always end with a feeling of
"I need more".

_<ProjectTitle/>_ is a first-person multiplayer action rpg dungeon crawler. The 
game blends the challenging directional aiming combat - like _Mordhau_ and _Chilvary_ - 
with interesting RPG classes like in _Warhammer: Vermintide 2_. It also include 
many other elements from our loved RPGs!

Stay tuned for playtest announcements!
